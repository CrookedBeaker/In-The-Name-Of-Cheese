# In The Name of Cheese

Play as Eric, cheese shop owner and amateur swordsman through five levels of top-down melee action, making use of magical spells along the way as you make your way through the Rat King's castle to reclaim what has been taken from you.

-----------------
*Eric enters his store late at night to find that his precious Wensleydale cheese has been taken! Left behind is a note from the Rat King himself taunting him. Now filled with rage, he takes up his trusty blade and sets out for the king's castle, ready to fight to the death to get his cheese back.*

*The plan? Sneak in through the sewers, and breach the castle undetected.*

*...or go in, killing everything in sight. It'll probably be more like that. In the end, the cheese justifies the methods.*
